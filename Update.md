# Update Log

## 11/06/2024: Major Refactoring and Structural Improvements

### 1. Python Code Refactoring
- Conducted a comprehensive refactoring of the Python codebase.
- Removed redundant code and updated file names to more accurately reflect their functions.
- Improved overall code quality and maintainability.

### 2. Directory Structure Reorganization
- Restructured the project's directory layout for better clarity and organization.
- Grouped related files and modules into logical directories.
- Improved ease of navigation and understanding of the project structure.

### 3. Path Resolution Logic Enhancement
- Updated the logic for resolving file and directory paths.
- Implemented a more robust method to ensure accurate path resolution across different environments.
- Reduced potential issues related to file not found errors and improved overall stability.

### 4. Separation of Terminal Run and Report Generation Logic
- Split the functionality for running tests in the terminal and generating reports into separate functions.
- Prepared groundwork for updating the report generation logic to output JSON format.
- This separation allows for easier maintenance and future enhancements of each feature independently.

### 5. UI Logic Centralization
- Moved all UI-related logic into a dedicated GUI file.
- Cleaned up `app.py`, removing UI clutter and improving its focus as the main entry point.
- Enhanced separation of concerns, making the codebase more modular and easier to maintain.

These updates significantly improve the project's structure, maintainability, and extensibility. The separation of concerns and improved organization pave the way for easier future developments and collaborations.

## 10/06/2024: Initial Application Development and Data Handling

### 1. Rapid Python Application Development for Grafana K6 Integration
- Developed a quick Python application to activate and interact with Grafana K6.
- Implemented basic functionality to trigger K6 tests through the application.
- Established a foundation for further development and refinement of the K6 test runner.

### 2. Data Reading and Categorization Functions
- Created functions to read and process data from the k6-data directory.
- Implemented a categorization system to organize test data based on a category model.
- Developed auto-update mechanisms to reflect changes in files and folders within the k6-data structure.
- Enhanced the application's ability to dynamically adapt to changes in the test data organization.

### 3. Exploration of TTK (Themed Tk) 
- Integrated TTK into the application for improved GUI aesthetics and functionality.
- Experimented with various TTK widgets and styling options.
- Laid the groundwork for a more polished and user-friendly interface in future iterations.

### 4. Temporary Code State
- Acknowledged the need for code cleanup and optimization.
- Prioritized functionality over code cleanliness for this initial development phase.
- Noted the intention to refactor and improve code structure in subsequent updates.

### 5. Git Ignore for Python
- Update .gitignore file from NextJS to Python

This rapid development session established the core functionality of the Grafana K6 test runner application. While the current state of the code may require refinement, it serves as a solid foundation for future improvements and feature additions.

## 08/06/2024: Initial Setup and Project Structure

### 1. Cross-Platform Grafana K6 Installation Script
- Developed a versatile script to automatically download and install the latest version of Grafana K6.
- Ensured compatibility across Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems.
- Implemented logic to move the K6 executable to the ./bin directory for easy access and management.

### 2. Docker Configuration Preparation
- Added necessary folders and files for future Docker integration.
- Laid the groundwork for containerization, although full Docker implementation is planned for a later stage.
- Noted that the current focus is on non-containerized development.

### 3. K6 Test Data Population
- Updated the k6-data directory with initial test scenarios.
- Planned for future automation to read from this directory and execute tests automatically.
- Established a structured approach for organizing and managing K6 test data.

### 4. GUI Considerations and Project Setup
- Explored options for creating a graphical user interface.
- Considered using NextJS for a web-based interface as a potential solution.
- Updated .gitignore file to exclude node_modules and other unnecessary files from version control.
- Prepared the project structure for potential integration with a web-based GUI in the future.

This initial setup phase focused on establishing the core project structure, ensuring cross-platform compatibility for K6 installation, and laying the groundwork for future development. While some aspects like Docker integration are prepared but not immediately implemented, the project is now well-positioned for further development of both backend functionality and user interface.
